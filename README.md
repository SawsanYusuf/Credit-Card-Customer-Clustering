___
Our main goal is to develop a customer segmentation model based on the credit card usage data of about 9,000 active credit card holders over the last six months. By the end of this analysis, we aim to answer the following questions:

What are the distinct segments of credit card users?
What defines each segment?
How can businesses leverage these insights?
